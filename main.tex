\section{Overview}

The Doctoral Program (DP) of the
CP conference is an annual scientific
event that has been held for more than two decades.
It aims to help students working
on different aspects of Constraint Programming
to socialise, network, and engage
with experts in the field.

Submissions are of two types:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Students with accepted papers at
	      the CP conference may submit a two-page abstract.
	\item Otherwise, a short paper of up to
	      eight pages (excluding references) must be submitted.
\end{enumerate}

The DP offers a dedicated mentoring
experience in which each student
is paired with a mentor,
who may be an early-career or senior researcher.
This structure provides students
with valuable opportunities
to receive guidance, gain insights from experts in the field,
and strengthen their career trajectory.
