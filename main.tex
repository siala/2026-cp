\section{Doctoral Program Overview}

The Doctoral Program of the CP conference is an annual scientific event taking place during
the CP conference.
It aims at helping students working on different aspects of Constraint Programming to
socialise, network, and get in touch with experts in the field.


Submissions are of two types:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Students with accepted papers at the CP conference may submit a two-page abstract.
	\item Otherwise, a short paper of up to 8 pages (excluding references) must be submitted.
\end{enumerate}
